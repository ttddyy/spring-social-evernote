# spring-social-evernote

## how to get


```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>net.ttddyy</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-social-evernote</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.3</version>
  </dependency>
```

### for version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

Both versions have dependency to `spring-social-core-1.1.0.M4`.   
By maven's transitive dependency mechanism, the jar file is downloaded from spring's milestone repository since `pom.xml` in `spring-social-evernote` specifies milestone repository.
However, if you want `mvn dependency:sources` to download all sources.jar or javadoc.jar, your project pom file needs to specify the milestone repository explicitly.

```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>spring-milestones</id>
            <name>Spring Milestones</name>
            <url>http://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
```

* Since version 1.0.2 uses release version of spring-social, this milestone configuration is not necessary.
